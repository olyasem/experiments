Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and/or other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve."
